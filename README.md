# FirestoreExampleProject
This app uses the Firebase Firestore NoSQL Database to allow users to save data into "Documents" within a "Collection".  Within the "Document" are a "title" and a "description".  Two EditText fields allow the user to create their own "title" and "description" for their note stored on Firestore.
